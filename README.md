# Welcome to my GitHub page
I am an aspiring Data Engineer. I have several years experience in R and Python programming as a Data Analyst in the public sector. I find it rewarding to problem-solve and build applications, such as my recent project to provide a centralised database by extracting data from a variety of data sources using Python classes.
